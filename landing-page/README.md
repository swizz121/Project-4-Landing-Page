# Landing Page Project
<p>This is the 4th and final Project of the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree Program - Mutli-section landing page. In this project I use DOM manipulation to create a navbar and automate styling each time a new section gets added. It is also showing the section that is currently in the users' view as "active". Lastly, the page scrolls to different sections when clicking on the related nav list item from the navbar menu</p>
